# Debian scripts

Little collection of scripts for desktop users

## Why

Debian defaults suck for desktop users. Themes and icons are ugly (yeah, I don't really like the XP's look, expecially in 2020), and packages don't get upgraded often.
I decided to write this scripts just to save time to a few friends, but I decided to share the work here :)

## What

This scripts aim to automatically download and install good icons and themes, just to provide better "defaults", and also switches to Testing (that repo is awesome)
